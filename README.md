### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To discover any trends in theater outcomes based on launch date, a pivot table was created to customize all of the Kickstarter data to only show outcomes and launch date by month with filters for the parent category and years. The parent category was filtered to only show theater. Using the pivot table, a line chart was generated to visualize the relationship between campaign outcomes and the month they were launched. The chart below revealed that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns (111) for theater was May. March, and September had roughly the same number of successful campaigns launched (high 50s). Campaigns launched in December were least likely to perform well and succeed. As for failed campaigns, the months May, June, July, August, and October all had roughly the same number of campaigns launched (50).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
